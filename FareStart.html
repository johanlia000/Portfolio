                      <p> As part of this project I played the role of a design consultant for my client,
                        FareStart. FareStart is a nonprofit organization that focuses on providing real solutions
                        to poverty and homelessness through food and food service. My job was to create a
                        cohesive visual system that represented the client's ethos and mission.
                      </p>

                      <p> After practicing design principles, typographic hierarchy, color, and integration of
                        visual elements, I used a 5-design phase to create a new visual system for FareStart
                        that communicated inclusiveness and excellence. This project's process included researching their mission,
                        redesigning their logo, creating icons and mobile interfaces, and combining those elements
                        into a cohesive brand book.

                      <h3><b>DESIGN RESEARCH</b></h3>
                      <br>
                        <p>This was the foundation of my rebranding project. For this part I worked with a team of 4 to conduct background research
                          on FareStart to understand their mission and how that mission
                          is currently visually represented in their brand identity. This helped me find inconsistencies within their brand.
                        </p>

                        <p>First, we researched their audiences and relationships. This helped get an understanding
                          on who our visuals would reach and connect with. Then we did a brand identity analysis where we
                          looked into their mission statement and engagement they promote and analyze how it was successfully or
                          unsuccessfully portrayed in their brand identity.
                        </p>

                        <br></br>

                        <p>
                          Our last step was to analyze their
                          social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) and  website to find inconsistencies with their mission
                          and while also finding confusing and unsuccessful design aspects.
                          All of this design research helped me redesign their visual brand identity to
                          successfully portray their mission and reach their targeted audiences.
                        </p>

                      <div class=category>
                        <hr style="border: .5px solid darkgray;" />
                        <h3><b>COLOR PALETTE</br></h3>
                        <br>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/original_farestart_colors.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="520" height="420"></center>
                        <p><center>Old Color Scheme</center></p>
                        <br>

                        <p> I liked that FareStart used the color orange as their main color, but it
                          wasn't the right shade of orange to convey their mission of compassion when
                          helping their workers and the community. I thought it was too bright and cool tone.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/colorInspo.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="350" height="250"></center>

                        <p><center>My color inspiration</center></p>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/downArrow.jpg" class="img-responsive"  width="70" height="70"></center>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/updatedColorScheme.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="570" height="470"></center>
                        <p><center>New Color Scheme</center></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I chose a complimentary color scheme of oranges and blues in order to convey
                            a sense of elegance and to reflect FareStart's mission of making a lasting impact. The warmth of the oranges conveys
                            comfort, while the brightness creates a sense of excitement for new beginnings. On the other hand, the blues
                            convey a sense of serenity and stability for both the workers and cutsomers.
                        </p>

                        <h3><b>LOGO REDESIGN</br></h3>

                          <img src="images/farestart/logoTransf.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="FareStart website homepage">
                          <br></br>
                          <p>
                            The original logo is very simple, but it gave off a soup kitchen vibe, which did not reflect
                            their goal of presenting themselves as a high class restaurant.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            I started the redesign of the logo by brainstorming FareStart's mission/goals that I would reflect in their logo.
                            Instead of focusing on the food aspect of FareStart,
                            I wanted to hone in on their unique mission of helping individuals grow by teaching them new life and work skills
                            through their restaurants and culinary apprenticeships.
                          </p>

                          <br></br>
                          <div class="picture-2-left">
                            <img src="images/farestart/logoSketch1.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="353px" height="586px">
                          </div>
                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <img src="images/farestart/logoSketch2.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="353px" height="586px">
                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>
                          <br></br>

                          <p> I show personal growth with leaves blooming from the spoon. While the spoon represents FareStart
                            teaching individuals skills through their culinary programs and apprenticeships. I made the
                            spoon be a darker orange and the leaves be a lighter orange to represent warmth and comfort can
                            grow fresh starts.
                          </p>

                      <h3><b>ICON DESIGN</br></h3>
                        <br>
                        <p> Before designing the icons, I brainstormed important features on FareStart's website that would be the
                          most used by their audience.
                          I concluded that the two most important features were filling out their catering form and
                          looking at their menus.
                        </p>

                        <div class=picture-2-left>
                          <center><img src="images/farestart/menu.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="200px" height="100px"></center>
                        </div>

                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <center><img src="images/farestart/catering.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="240px" height="140px"></center>
                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>

                          <div class="picture-2-left">
                            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Menu Icon.</strong></p>

                          </div>

                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Catering Icon.</strong></p>

                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>

                          <p> The menu icon leads the user to the list of FareStart's
                            different menus, and the catering icon leads the user to its catering form to fill out. Since FareStart
                            wanted to be a high class restaurant I chose for the icons to be clean and simple. The icons
                            are the same color scheme as my logo to create cohesion across the visuals. I also wanted to match
                            the rounded corners and boldness of the spoon in the logo with the icons to convey a sense of friendliness and warmth.
                          </p>

                      <h3><b>MOBILE WIREFRAMES</b></h3>
                      <br>
                      <p> I started this part of the project by viewing their current website
                        and finding users' <b>pain points</b>. One major pain point I found was on their catering
                        form page. They have one catering form but multiple catering menus, one of which is specific
                        to weddings.</p>
                      <p>I saw this as a paint point because FareStart wants to be seen as an
                        esteemed restaurant that is able to cater important events such as weddings but doesn't make
                        it intuitive or helpful for wedding planners to make a catering appointment specific to weddings that include tastings.
                        I thought FareStart should have a form that is <b>specific to weddings</b>.
                        <br></br>After choosing to focus on a wedding catering form, I created three wireframes
                        to show the micro interaction of choosing an item on their menu to request to taste
                        during a wedding catering meeting with FareStart.
                      </p>

                        <p> This was my first official design class. We had an ideation exercise where we had to design logos for a product that combined
                            dolphins and bobby pins. At first, I struggled to come up with more than 5 ideas, but the more I let my
                            ideas run wild, ideating became easier. I used this new mindset when designing my entire brand book. It
                            helped me break free from basic designs and create unique designs.</p>

                        <p> When making this brand book I learned that it's crucial to define your design communication
                            goals early on. This helps you stay focused on your end goal for the design.
                            When I felt lost and stuck on ideas, I went back to my communication goals to get myself back on track. </p>
