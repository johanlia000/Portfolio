                    <div class="info2">
                      <p> As part of this project, I played the role of a <b>design consultant</b> for my client,
                        FareStart. FareStart is a nonprofit organization that focuses on providing real solutions
                        to poverty and homelessness through food and food service. My "job" was to create a
                        <b>cohesive visual system that represented the client's ethos and mission.</b>
                      </p>

                      <p> After practicing design principles, typographic hierarchy, color, and integration of
                        visual elements, I used a<b> 5-phase design process to create a new visual system for FareStart
                        that communicated their values of inclusiveness and excellence.</b> This project's design process included researching their mission,
                        redesigning their logo, creating icons and mobile interfaces, and combining those elements
                        into a cohesive brand book.

                      <h3><b>DESIGN RESEARCH</b></h3>
                      <br>
                        <p>Research was the foundation of my rebranding project. For this phase I worked in a team of four and conducted background research
                           to <b>understand FareStart's mission and how that mission is currently and visually represented in their brand identity.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>First, we researched FareStart's <b>audiences and relationships.</b> This helped us gain an understanding
                          of who our visuals would reach and impact. Then, we analyzed their brand identity. This entailed <b>examining their
                          mission statement</b> and the engagement they promoted followed by analysis of how it was <b>successfully or
                          unsuccessfully portrayed in their brand identity.</b>
                        </p>

                        <br></br>
                        <img src="images/farestart/websiteFareStart.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="FareStart website homepage">
                        <br></br>

                        <p>We <b>analyzed their social media</b> (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) to find content that
                           was <b>inconsistent with their mission and to locate confusing and unsuccessful design</b> elements.
                          This thorough design research helped me redesign FareStart's visual brand identity
                          so that it more successfully portrayed their mission and reached their target audiences with
                          a <b>consistent and cohesive message.</b>
                        </p>
                      </div>

                      <div class=category>

                        <h3><b>COLOR PALETTE</br></h3>
                        <br>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/original_farestart_colors.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="520" height="420"></center>

                        <br>

                        <p> I <b>appreciated FareStart's use of the color orange as their main color,</b> but it
                          wasn't the right shade of orange to convey their mission of compassion towards
                          their workers and the community. I thought it was <b>too bright and cool toned.</b>
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <center><img src="images/farestart/colorInspo.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="350" height="250"></center>

                        <br>
                        <p>I chose a <b>complementary color scheme of oranges and blues in order to convey
                            a sense of elegance and to reflect FareStart's mission of making a lasting impact.</b> The warmth of the oranges represents
                            comfort, while the brightness creates a sense of excitement for new beginnings. In contrast, the blues
                            embodies a sense of stability and longevity.
                        </p>

                    <div class=category>

                        <h3><b>LOGO REDESIGN</br></h3>

                          <img src="images/farestart/logoTransf.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="FareStart website homepage">
                          <br></br>
                          <p>
                            The original logo is very simple, but it <b>exuded a soup kitchen vibe, which did not reflect
                            their goal of presenting themselves as a high-end, fine dining restaurant.</b>
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            I started the redesign of the logo by brainstorming FareStart's mission and goals that I reflected
                            in the new logo. <b>Instead of focusing on the food and culinary aspects of FareStart,
                            I honed in on their unique mission of helping individuals grow</b> by teaching them new life and work skills
                            through their restaurants and culinary apprenticeships.
                          </p>

                          <p></b> The<b> spoon represents FareStart's core mission of teaching individuals work and life skills</b>
                            through their culinary programs and apprenticeships. <b>I conveyed personal growth with leaves blooming from the spoon.</b>
                            I designed the spoon with a darker orange and the leaves with a lighter orange to <b>represent that
                            from warmth and comfort, fresh starts can grow.</b>
                          </p>

                      <h3><b>ICON DESIGN</br></h3>
                        <br>
                        <p> First, I brainstormed important features on FareStart's website that are the
                          most used by their audience.
                          I concluded that the <b>two most important features were filling out their catering form and
                          reviewing their menus.</b>
                        </p>

                        <div class=picture-2-left>
                          <center><img src="images/farestart/menu.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="200px" height="100px"></center>
                        </div>

                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <center><img src="images/farestart/catering.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="240px" height="140px"></center>
                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>

                          <div class="picture-2-left">
                            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>New menu icon</strong></p>

                          </div>

                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>New catering icon</strong></p>

                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>

                          <p> The menu icon directs the user to the list of FareStart's
                            various menus, and the catering icon leads the user to its catering form. Since <b>FareStart
                            considers itself an upscale restaurant, I chose to create clean and simple icons.</b> The icons
                            are the same color scheme as my logo to create cohesion across the visuals. I also matched
                            the <b>rounded corners and boldness</b> of the logo's spoon with the icons to <b>convey a sense of friendliness.</b>
                          </p>

                    </div>


                    <div class=category>
                      <hr style="border: .5px solid darkgray;" />

                      <h3><b>MOBILE WIREFRAMES</b></h3>
                      <br>
                      <p> I started this phase of the project by viewing FareStart's current website
                        and identified users' <b>pain points. I found one major pain point on their catering
                        form page.</b> They have a single catering form but multiple catering menus, one of which is specific
                        to weddings.
                      </p>

                      <p>I saw this as a pain point because unlike other esteemed restaurants, <b>FareStart's website was not
                        intuitive for users to make a wedding catering appointment.</b> Specifically, it lacked a way to choose menu
                        selections and <b>easily request a taste testing appointment,</b> which is a common practice.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        After choosing to focus on a wedding catering form, I <b>created three wireframes
                        to show the micro interaction of selecting an item, then requesting a tasting during the wedding catering meeting.
                      </p>

                        <p> This was my first official design class. We had an ideation exercise where we had to design logos for a product that combined
                            dolphins and bobby pins. At first, I struggled to come up with more than 5 ideas, but <b>the more I let my
                            ideas run wild, ideating became easier.</b> I used this <b>new mindset when designing my entire brand book.</b> It
                            helped me break free from common designs and create unique designs.</p>

                        <h3><i>Set clear design goals</i></h3>
                        <p> When making this brand book I learned that it's <b>crucial to define design communication
                            goals early.</b> This allowed me to stay focused on my end goal for the design.
                            <b>When I felt stuck on ideas, I returned to my design communication goals</b> to get myself back on track.</p>
