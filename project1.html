                      <p> As part of this project I played the role of a design consultant for my client,
                        FareStart. FareStart is a nonprofit organization that focuses on providing real solutions
                        to poverty and homelessness through food and food service. My job was to create a
                        cohesive visual system that represented the client's ethos and mission.
                      </p>

                      <p> After practicing design principles, typographic hierarchy, color, and integration of
                        visual elements I used a 5-design phase to create a new visual system for FareStart
                        that communicated inclusiveness and excellence. This included researching their mission,
                        redesigning their logo, creating icons and mobile interfaces, and combining those elements
                        into a brand book.

                      <h3><b>DESIGN RESEARCH</b></h3>

                        <p>This was the foundation of my rebranding project. For this part I worked with a team of 4 to conduct backgorund research
                          on FareStart, the client company, to understand their mission and how that mission
                          is currently visually represented in their brand identity and how it can
                          it can be improved.
                        </p>

                        <p>First, we researched their audiences and relationships. This helped get an understanding
                          on who our visuals would reach and connect with. Then we did a brand identity analysis where we
                          looked into their mission statement and engagement they promote and analyze of how it was successfully or
                          unsuccessfully portrayed in their brand identity.
                        </p>

                        <br></br>

                        <p>
                          Our last step was to analyze their
                          social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) and  website to find inconsistencies with their mission
                          and confusing and unsuccessful design aspects.
                          All of this design research helped me redesign their visual brand identity to
                          successfully portray their mission and reach their targeted audiences.

                    <div class=category>

                        <h3><b>LOGO REDESIGN</br></h3>

                          <img src="images/logoTransf.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="FareStart website homepage">
                          <br></br>
                          <p>
                            The original logo is very simple and I liked the warm tone orange that reflects their mission of
                            compassion in helping people. But it gave off a soup kitchen vibe, which did not reflect
                            their goal of presenting themselves as a high class restaurant.
                          </p>

                          <br></br>
                          <div class="picture-2-left">
                            <img src="images/logoSketch1.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="353px" height="586px">
                          </div>
                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <img src="images/logoSketch2.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="353px" height="586px">
                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>
                          <br></br>

                          <p>
                            I started the redesign of the logo by brainstorming FareStart's mission and goals and then the inportant parts
                            of their mission I wanted to include in their logo. Instead of focusing on the food aspect of FareStart,
                            I wanted to hone in on their unique mission of helping individuals grow by teaching them new life and work skills
                            through food. I show the personal growth with leaves blooming from the spoon; the spoon representing FareStart
                            teaching individuals skills through their culinary programs and apprenticeships. I chose to stick with the orange
                            color because it creates a sense of warmth and comfort to resemble FareStart's mission of caring and helping others.
                          </p>

                      <h3><b>ICON DESIGN</br></h3>
                        <p> Before designing the icons, I brainstormed important features on FareStart's website.
                          I concluded that the two most important actions were signing up for catering and
                          looking at their menus.
                        </p>

                        <div class=picture-2-left>
                          <center><img src="images/menu.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="200px" height="100px"></center>

                          <div class="picture-2-right">
                            <center><img src="images/catering.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="240px" height="140px"></center>

                          <div class="picture-2-left">
                            <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Menu Icon.</strong>
                              <br></p>

                          </div>

                          <div class="clearfix"></div>

                          <p> The menu icon leads the user to the list of FareStart's
                            different menus, and the catering icon leads the user to its catering form to fill out. The icons
                            are the same color scheme as the logo to create cohesion across the visuals. I also wanted to match
                            the rounded corners and boldness of the spoon in the logo with the icons to convey a sense of friendliness and warmth.
                          </p>

                      <h3><b>MOBILE WIREFRAMES</b></h3>

                      <p> I created three wireframes to show the micro interaction of choosing a menu item to taste
                        during a wedding catering meeting with FareStart.

                             pain points for the user. I targeted the issue with their catering form
                             did not allow for user specifications. They have multiple menus for catering,
                             one specific to weddings, so I chose to create a form specifically for users who
                             need wedding catering. </p>
