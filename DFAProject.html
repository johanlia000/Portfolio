                   <p> As the project lead of my Design for America at Univesrity of Washington (DFA) project, I led a
                     5-person interdisciplinary team in the design of an original, wearable technology prototype that
                     helps high school students relax during a panic attack at school. Through this project I practiced

                   <br>

                   <center><img src="images/dfa/ivyLeague.png" class="img-responsive" width="400px" height="200px"></center>
                   <br>

                   <p>My group's <b>problem area was high school student stress and anxiety.</b>
                     High school students struggle with the pressure of achieving high standardized
                     test scores and maintaining a 4.0 GPA while taking multiple AP/IB courses in hopes of
                     being accepted to a prestigious college. This is a growing problem in the Seattle area,
                     as massive amounts of <b>pressure and stress negatively affects students’ mental health.</b>
                   </p>
                </div>

                    <h3><b>SECONDARY RESEARCH</b></h3>
                    <br>

                    <p>To <b>learn more about our problem space,</b> we dove into secondary research.</p>

                    <p>For our secondary research it was important to <b>focus on learning more about the symptoms and definition of anxiety,
                      existing solutions, mindfulness, and academic pressure.</b> This helped us get a solid foundation in order to
                      thoroughly understand our problem area.
                    </p>

                    <br>


                    <p> Aftering researching exisiting solutions in order to help us understand the market, <b>we learned that current
                      anxiety apps revolve around mindfulness and meditation that help people
                      track their mood, offer relaxation and breathing tips, or let you play a relaxing game.</b>
                      This helped target growth areas within the current market.

                   <h3><b>PRIMARY RESEARCH</b></h3>
                   <br>

                   <p>For our primary research we <b>worked closely with our community partner, Roosevelt High School,</b>
                     to understand high schooler’s thoughts and feelings regarding their own mental health. Our <b>methods
                     included an online survey, love/hate boxes, and one one-on-one interview with a high school junior.</b>
                     Because mental health is such a sensitive subject, we ensured that our research methods were thoughtful and anonymous.
                   </p>
                   <br>

                   <h4>ONLINE SURVEY</h4>
                   <p>The purpose for our online survey was to <b>get an understanding</b> of high schooler’s feelings towards
                     their own or their friends’ mental health, what makes them stressed, and how they relax. We received <b>240 responses.</b>
                   </p>

                   <div class=picture-2-left>
                     <center><img src="images/dfa/loveBoxes.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="300px" height="100px"></center>

                   <div class="clearfix"></div>
                   <br>

                   <h4>LOVE/HATE BOXES</h4>
                   <p> We chose to implement love/hate boxes in Roosevelt High School’s teen health center.
                     This was used to give a more open ended question to <b>understand how high schoolers feel.</b>
                     We had two boxes, one for love and one for hate. Students who felt comfortable wrote down what
                     objects, activities, and people whom they <b>love and/or hate on an anonymous slip of paper.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <h4>ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW</h4>
                   <p> Lastly, I conducted a one-on-one interview with a high school junior to learn more about
                     a new mindfulness club at the high school and <b>listen to a student’s perspective about mental health,
                     specifically anxiety.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <h4>RESULTS</h4>
                   <p><b>1)</b> <b>Teens are stressed because they feel like they have to balance</b> school assignments,
                     college applications, and extracurricular activities.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <p><b>2)</b> Students are <b>self aware and know they are stressed</b> when their behavior
                     is more aggressive and they have difficulty focusing on every day tasks.
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <p><b>3)</b> To <b>relieve their stress</b> high schoolers enjoy hanging out with friends,
                     listening to music, or taking deep breaths.
                   </p>

                  <h3><b>IDEATION</b></h3>


                  <br>
                  <center><img src="images/dfa/howmightwe.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="550px" height="300px"></center>
                  <br>

                  <center><p>After the research phase we created our project’s <b>How Might We statement.</b></p></center>

                  <br></br>
                  <center><img src="images/dfa/statement.png" class="img-responsive" width="550px" height="300px"></center>
                  <br></br>

                  <br>
                  <p>Initially, we thought about <b>creating an app</b> that would help high schoolers with their anxiety,
                    but we didn’t want to just create another mindfulness app. After speaking with our design coaches they
                    <b>challenged us to create something new and futureistic</b>
                  </p>

                  <p> We then created <b>3 design principles</b> that would be at the core of our ideation phase.</p>

                  <br></br>
                  <center><img src="images/dfa/pillars.png" class="img-responsive" width="700px" height="400px"></center>
                  <br></br>

                  <p> We became interested in the tech area of wearables. <b>We ideated different wearable
                    stress relieving devices: a sticky, thin pad they could wear on their heart, attachable monitor on pant waists,
                    a or modern bracelet.</b>
                  </p>

                  <p>We ideated <b>utilizing calming blue and green lighting and pulsating motions</b>
                    to calm students during panic attacks. Also, based on our primary research, it was important to <b>incorporate
                    a customizable music aspect</b> to the wearable. But our biggest goal was to create a wearable technology that would
                    <b>give the student a support system they could trust.</b>
                  </p>

                  <center><p><b><i>Balloon protoype of "breathing" feature</b></i></p></center>
                  <br>

                  <p> Narrowing down our focus we ideated futuristic in-classroom devices. We then concluded in <b>creating a wearable
                    technology that would be implemented in a classroom environment.</b> We used sewing, cardboard, balloons,
                    and 3D printing to prototype.

                  <p><b>The Coeur system is an entire network</b> that utilizes a high-tech stress ball to create community support for
                    students dealing with panic attacks. There are two components to the system: <b>the stress ball and docking station.</b>
                  </p>
                  <br>


                  <center><img src="images/dfa/userStory.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="330px" height="450px"></center>
                  <br>
                  <center><p><i><b>User Story</b></i></p></center>

                  <br>
                  <p> At school, a student is able to <b>discreetly carry around the stress ball that will “breathe” with them during a panic attack</b> through
                    gentle expansion and compression. Tha Coeur System will be <b>connected to the student's chosen support system</b> such as educators, nurses, and parents
                    through an app. The ball will <b>alert the student's support system</b> when a student is experiencing a panic attack with customizable vibrations.
                  </p>

                  <p> <b>At home,</b> the Coeur Ball will rest on its wireless docking station that <b>illuminates calming blue and green light.</b> It will also serve
                    as a speaker that can <b>play music</b> to help with generalized anxiety.
                  </p>

                  <p> To showcase our work and project <b>we presented at Artefact to community members, professors,
                    and Artefact employees at our final expo.</b>
