                   <p>My team's <b>problem area centered on high school student stress and anxiety.</b>
                     College-bound students struggle with the pressure of achieving high test scores and GPAs
                     in hopes of being admitted to a prestigious college. Local schools have raised this as a
                     growing problem in the Seattle area, as significant amounts of <b>pressure and stress negatively affects students’ mental health.</b>
                   </p>

                    <h3><b>SECONDARY RESEARCH</b></h3>
                    <br>

                    <p></b>We dove into secondary research to <b>learn more about our problem space.</p>

                    <p>Our secondary research <b>focused on learning more about the symptoms and definition of anxiety,
                      existing solutions, mindfulness, and academic pressure.</b> We gained a solid foundation in the topic of anxiety
                      to ground us in our problem space.

                    <p> Researching exisiting solutions helped us understand the market. <b>We learned that current
                      anxiety apps revolve around mindfulness and meditation that help users
                      track their mood, offer relaxation and breathing tips, or let users play relaxing games.</b>
                      This helped us target potential growth areas within the current market.

                   <h3><b>PRIMARY RESEARCH</b></h3>
                   <br>

                   <p>We <b>worked closely with our community partner, Roosevelt High School, </b>
                     to understand students' thoughts and feelings regarding their own mental health. As project lead, I
                     initiated all outreach and coordination with our project sponsor. Our <b>methods
                     included an online survey, love/hate boxes, and one interview with a high school junior.</b>
                     Because mental health is such a sensitive subject, we ensured that our research methods preserved student privacy.
                   </p>
                   <br>

                   <h4>ONLINE SURVEY</h4>
                   <p>We distributed a Google Survey to several schools throughout the Seattle area. The purpose of our online survey was
                     to better understand high schoolers' <b>feelings toward their own mental health, stress triggers, and
                     how they relax. We received 240 responses.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <div class=picture-2-left>
                     <center><img src="images/dfa/loveBoxes.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="300px" height="100px"></center>

                   <div class="clearfix"></div>
                   <br>

                   <h4>LOVE/HATE BOXES</h4>
                   <p> We implemented love/hate boxes in Roosevelt High School’s teen health center.
                     Boxes were used to ask more open ended questions to <b>further understand how students feel.</b>
                     We had two boxes, one for love and one for hate. Students anonymously wrote on a slip of paper what
                     <b>objects, activities, and people whom they love and/or hate.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <h4>ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW</h4>
                   <p> Lastly, I conducted a one-on-one interview with a high school junior to learn more about
                     a new mindfulness club at the high school and <b>to listen to a student’s perspective about mental health,
                     specifically anxiety.</b> Due to time and school constraints, only one interview was possible.
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <h4>RESULTS</h4>
                   <p><b>1)</b> Many teens are stressed because <b>they feel challenged to balance school assignments,
                     college applications, and extracurricular activities.</b>
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <p><b>2)</b> Students are <b>self-aware and know they are stressed</b> when their behavior
                     is more aggressive and they have difficulty focusing on every day tasks.
                   </p>

                   <br>
                   <p><b>3)</b> To <b>relieve their stress</b> students enjoy hanging out with friends,
                     listening to music, and concentrating on their breathing.

                  <br>

                  <center><p>After the research phase we created our project’s <b>How Might We statement.</b></p></center>

                  <br></br>
                  <center><img src="images/dfa/statement.png" class="img-responsive" width="550px" height="300px"></center>
                  <br></br>

                  <br>
                  <p>Initially, we thought about <b>prototyping a phone app</b> that would help students with their anxiety,
                    but we didn’t want to create just another mindfulness app. Our Artefact design coaches
                    <b>challenged us to design something new and futuristic.</b>
                  </p>

                  <p> We then created <b>three design principles</b> that represented the core of our ideation phase.</p>

                  <br></br>
                  <center><img src="images/dfa/pillars.png" class="img-responsive" width="700px" height="400px"></center>
                  <br></br>

                  <p> We became interested in the area of technology wearables. <b>We ideated different wearable
                    stress relieving devices: a sticky, thin pad students could wear on their heart, an attachable monitor on pant waists,
                    and a modern bracelet.</b>
                  </p>

                  <p>We ideated <b>utilizing calming blue and green lighting and pulsating motions</b>
                    to calm students during panic attacks. Also, based on our primary research, it was important to <b>incorporate
                    a customizable music element</b>. But our main goal was to create a wearable technology that would
                    <b>provide the student a support system they could trust.</b>
                  </p>

                  <center><p><b><i>Balloon protoype of "breathing" feature</b></i></p></center>
                  <br>

                  <p>Narrowing down our focus, we ideated futuristic, in-classroom devices. This led us to <b>create a wearable
                    technology prototype intended for a classroom environment.</b> We used sewing, cardboard, balloons,
                    and ultimately a 3D printer to create our prototype.

                  <p><b>The Coeur system is an entire network</b> that utilizes a high-tech stress ball to create community support for
                    students dealing with panic attacks. There are two physical components to the system: <b>the stress ball and the docking station.</b>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <center><img src="images/dfa/userStory.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="330px" height="450px"></center>

                  <center><p><i><b>User story</b></i></p></center>

                  <br>
                  <p> At school, a student is able to <b>discreetly carry the stress ball that will “breathe” with
                    them during a panic attack</b> through gentle expansion and compression. The Coeur System will be
                    <b>connected to the student's chosen support resource</b> such as educators, nurses, and parents
                    through a wireless app (future feature). The Coeur ball will <b>alert the student's support resource with customizable vibrations
                    </b> when a student is experiencing a panic attack.
                  </p>

                  <p> <b>At home,</b> the Coeur ball will rest on its wireless docking station that
                    <b>illuminates calming blue and green light.</b> The docking station serves
                    as a speaker that <b>plays music</b> to help with generalized anxiety.
                  </p>

                  <p><b>We presented our project work and prototype</b> to community members, professors, industry mentors,
                    and Artefact employees at our final showcase expo.
