                   <h3><b>DATASET</b></h3>

                     <p>My team and I were all sophomores so the college admissions process was still fresh in our minds. We
                       knew we wanted to <b>make an interactive application that would help graduating high school students choose a college.</b>
                       The <b>primary audiences were high school and college transfer students intending to apply
                       to college,</b> and the secondary audience was the applicants' parents.
                     </p>

                     <p>The dataset was sourced from the U.S Department of Education. It is from the most recent 20 years and includes admission
                       rates, tuition rates, SAT/ACT scores, etc.
                       Click <a href = https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/><strong>here </strong></a>to view the data.
                       <b>We captured the data using R by reading the downloaded CSV file.</b> We narrowed
                       down our dataset based on <b>key information students typically want to know about colleges</b> such as location, costs,
                       diversity, test socres, and admission statistics.

                    <h3><b>CODING</b></h3>

                    <p>Due to previous coding collaboration experience, I recognized the <b>importance of a shared game plan.</b>
                       I convened everyone and created a project plan that <b>delegated the project's tasks</b> and set
                       deadlines to keep the project on track. We <b>collaborated using Git and coded our project in R.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p> <b>This project exercised my prior knowledge of Git</b> that had been gained from
                        being the lead software devloper on my high school's robotics team.
                        This enabled me to help my teammates code collaboratively and solve merge conflict using
                        Git. My team and I <b>quickly learned how to clearly communicate our intentions and actions to avoid merge issues.</b>
                        We used Slack to communicate in between in-person meetings.
                    </p>

                    <p> <b>I was responsible for coding the graphs showing the scores.</b> I used R packages such as <b>DPLYR, ggplot2, and plotly</b>
                      for data wrangling and creating interactive visualizations. To create the interactive web application I used the Shiny
                      R package.
                    </p>

                    <center><h3> See R code <a href = https://github.com/nickv23/info201_final_project target="_blank">here</a></h3></center>

                    <p> After surveying a few recent high school graduates, I confirmed that when applying to colleges,
                        students are especially curious about ACT/SAT admissions scores. I decided to <b>create bar charts
                        that visually compared the cumulative math, writing, and reading scores</b> of a particular school's
                        accepted students.
                    </p>

                    <p> As seen in the above figures, the user is <b>prompted to select a state and college from two drop down menus.</b>
                       It then <b>shows one set of bar chart</b> for ACT scores and another for SAT scores, as some
                      students take the ACT and others take the SAT. This allows all students to assess
                      the admitted students' scores and <b>compare</b> these stats with what they got achieved or should strive towards.

                    <h3><b>SHINY APP</b></h3>

                    <p> As a team we created <b>four interactive widgets</b> that presented the data through easy to read visualizations.</p>

                    <p> <b><i> 1. Location:</b></i> The locations tab allows students to<b> locate all the available colleges</b> within a selected state.
                      Hovering a mouse over a marker displays the full name of the college.</p>

                    <p> <b><i>2. Diversity:</b></i> The diversity tab allows students to <b>examine race data for colleges.</b> Students choose a state that
                      then choose a college within that state. A pie chart generates that reflects the percentages of each race attending that school.
                      Hovering over the <b></i>pie chart slice shows exact percentages</b>. A table also presents the data alongside the graph.
                    </p>

                    <p> <b><i> 3. Score:</b></i> The score tab allows students to look at the median ACT and SAT scoresfor a particular school.
                      The user chooses a state and then selects a college that is in that state from the drop down menu. <b>A generated bar graph display the
                      midpoint ACT</b> and another bar graph <b>shows the midpoint SAT score.</b> For the ACT this includes midpoints for cumulative, english,
                      math, and writing scores. For the SAT this includes averages for math, reading, and writing scores.</p>

                    <p> <b><i>4. Admission Statistics: </b></i>The admissions tab allows students to <b>easily compare their
                      selected colleges' admission rates.</b> Furthermore, students can view a table of information: Name, city, state,
                      in-state tuition, out of state tuition, and links to college's website.</p>

                      <p> Before starting to code, my team sat down and <b>agreed to the deliverables each person was
                        responsible for completing</b> and their respective due dates. I learned that this approach helps
                        projects stay on track and <b>reinforces accountability</b> across team members.

                      <p> I learned that it's <b>fun and helpful to play around with your code.</b> I found <b>multiple bugs in my code</b> simply by
                          playing. Once I found one bug, I <b>reconsidered the edge cases of my code</b>. In the end,
                          playing around expanded my awareness for <b>potential bugs in future coding projects.</b> </p>
