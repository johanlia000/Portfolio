                   <h3><b>DATASET</b></h3>

                     <p>My team and I were all sophomores so college admissions were still fresh in our minds. We
                       knew we wanted to make an app that would help graduating high school students apply/choose a college.
                       So, the primary audiences were high school and college transfer studnets wanting to apply
                       to college, and the secondary audience were the applicants' parents. We narrowed
                       down our dataset based on key information studnets would want to know such as location,
                       diversity, test socres, and admission statistics.
                     </p>

                     <p>The dataset we used is from the U.S Department of Education. It is from the most recent years (past 20 years) showing admission
                       rates, tuition rates, SAT/ACT scores, and more.
                       Click <a href = https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/><strong>here </strong></a>to see the data.
                       We attained the data in R through reading the downloaded CSV file.
                     </p>

                    <h3><b>CODING</b></h3>

                    <p>With previous coding collaboration experience I had everyone meet
                      and create a game plan that would delegate the project's work and set deadlines to keep the project on track.
                      We coded our project in R and collaborated through Github. I practiced my prior knowledge with Github from
                      being the lead software devloper on my high school's robotics team with this project.
                      I helped my team mates with code collaboration and solving merge issues when using
                      Github. My team and I quickly learned how to clearly communicate our intentions and actions to avoid coding issues.
                      We used Slack to communicate between in-person meetings.
                    </p>

                    <p> I was responsible for coding the scores graphs. To help me I used R packages such as DPLYR, ggplot2, and plotly
                      for data wrangling and creating interactive visualizations. To create the interactive web application we used the Shiny
                      R package.
                    </p>

                    <p> When applying to schools, students want to know the average accepted admissions ACT/SAT scores. I decided to
                      create bar charts that would show the comparison in scores from cumulative, math, writing, and reading sections in the
                      standarized tests from a chosen school.
                    </p>

                    <p> The user is prompted to select a state and college from two drop down menus.
                       It then shows one bar chart for ACT scores and one for SAT scores as some
                      students take the ACT and others take the SAT. This allows all students to look
                      at the college's admission scores and compare with what they got or should strive towards.

                    <h3><b>SHINY APP</b></h3>

                    <p> We created four interactive widgets that showed the data through visualizations.</p>
                    <p> <b> 1. Location:</b> The locations tab allows you locate all the available colleges within a selected state.
                      Hover your mouse over a marker to get the full name of the college.</p>
                    <p> <b>2. Diversity:</b> The diversity tab allows you to look at race data for colleges. Simply choose a state that
                      you're interested in and then choose a college within that state. A pie chart should show up that gives the percentages of each race.
                      You can hover over the pie chart slices and see the exact percentages if it is hard to read. A table also renders giving the same data
                      on race percentages to allow the user to see the data in a graph and table view.</p>
                    <p> <b> 3. Score:</b> The score tab allows students to look at the median/middle scores (both ACT and SAT) for a particular school.
                      Choose a state and then choose a college/university that is in that state from the drop down menu. A bar graph will show the
                      midpoint ACT and another bar graph will show the midpoint SAT scores. For the ACT this includes midpoint of cumulative, english,
                      math, and writing scores. For the SAT this includes average, math, reading, and writing scores.</p>
                    <p> <b>4. Admission Statistics: </b>The admissions tab allows students to look at their selected colleges' admission rates and compare
                      them to one another. Furthermore, students can also look at a table of information with the name, city, state,
                      instate tuition, outstate tuition, and the college's website.</p>
