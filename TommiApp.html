                      <p> As a team member <b>I designed and engineered an iOS app Tommi,</b> a lovable, interactive avatar that helps parents
                        <b>balance their kids tech usage</b> so that there kids can create a healthy relationship with technology. I
                        <b>applied my UX background</b> and design thinking skills when prototyping and engineering our iOS app on
                          Swift. I also received hands on <b>coaching from Microsoft product managers and developers.</b>

                      <h3>PROBLEM AREA</h3>
                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/pills.png" class="img-responsive" width="500" height="300"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> Our probelm area was <b>tech addiction.</b> I see this as a growing issue within society,
                          <b>especially in children.</b> Personally, I see this when kids are with family and the kids only want to play on their devices
                          instead of interacting with others. We wanted to <b>nip this addiction in the bud</b> because it’s important
                        for kids to have a healthy relationship with tech early on so that they become <b>responsible tech users in the future.</b>
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <h3>USER IDEATION</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> To represent our <b>user demographic we created two personas:</b> a working parent and her child. This
                        initiated <b>empathy</b> within my team and allowed us to <b>better understand our user's experiences, behaviors, and goals.</b>
                        It also shaped our user journeys.
                      </p>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/wendy.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/charlie.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> Next, with Wendy and Charlie as our inspiration, we created a <b>user journey map</b> to solidify our goals and understand
                        the <b>relationship between our user and app.</b>
                      </p>

                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/wendyJ.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> Lastly, we generated <b>user stories to show key, wanted features of the app.</b> This ensured we created an
                        app that will be useful to our users.
                      </p>

                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/users.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                    </div>

                    <div class=category>
                      <hr style="border: .5px solid darkgray;" />
                      <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> To better understand the current market, we performed a <b>SWOT analysis</b> (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats).</p>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/apple.png" class="img-responsive" width="300" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> We saw that our <b>biggest competitor was Apple Screen Time.</b> It is successful because it has a
                        beautiful, friendly UI, it’s already integrated into the iPhone, and can be used across multiple devices.
                      </p>

                      <p> But I saw that there was a <b>gap with Apple Screen Time and other tech time moderator apps.</b>
                        They all focused on monitoring and setting time limits on screen time and apps, but they
                        <b>lacked a fun, interactive aspect for kids.</b> That’s when I had the <b>idea of Tommi, a cute, lovable
                        interactive avatar</b> that would be the mediator between the parent and child. This would be a more
                        <b>digestible and fun way</b> for kids to understand tech time boundaries.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <h3>APP IDEA</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> After a team brainstorming session, we listed the <b>app’s main components and avatar.</b></p>
                      <br>

                      <h3>USER RESEARCH BBQ</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> At the user research BBQ <b>I pitched our initial app idea</b> to parents and children.
                        As a team, we pitched our app idea and <b>received positive feedback</b> from 12 parents and
                        2 children.
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <p><b>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</b></p>

                      <p><b>1.</b> One family of 4 kids told us that they <b>already have a system like Tommi at home,</b> but with <br>physical coins
                        so they thought it would be great to have it organized into one app</p>
                      <p><b>2.</b> Some parents did <b>not</b> want their kids to be able to <b>buy more app time</b></p>
                      <p><b>3.</b> The <b>kids responded positively to Tommi</b> and thought he was adorable</p>
                      <p><b>4.</b> Most parents said they <b>liked the quest system the most,</b> as this was unique and useful</p>
                    </div>



                    <div class=category>
                      <hr style="border: .5px solid darkgray;" />
                      <h3>IDEATION</h3>
                      <br>

                      <div class=picture-2-left>
                        <center><img src="images/TommiApp/store2.png" class="img-responsive" width="250px" height="350px"></center>
                      </div>

                      <div class="picture-2-right">
                        <br></br>
                        <p> After the user research BBQ, my team discussed the feedback.
                          <b> Customization was an important core value because every family is different</b> and has
                          different rules and values around technology.
                        </p>
                        <p> Since some parents stated they did not want their
                          kid to have more tech time than intially allowed. It was meaningful to our users that we <b>create another
                            option for the kids to spend their earned time coins on.</b> I thought that an <b>accessory store
                              would be a fun way</b> for the kids to interact with Tommi.
                        </p>
                      </div>

                      <div class="clearfix"></div>
                      <br></br>

                      <p>After talking with our product manager coach,
                          we were unsure what kind of <b>app statistics we wanted to show the parent.</b>
                          Our coach <b>challenged us</b> to think about how the statistics can support our goal
                          of helping create a healthy relationship with tech. After a lot of discussion,
                          we concluded in showing parents graphs showing their <b>kid’s app time usage per app category and
                          how much time coins their kid spends on each app category.</b>
                      </p>

                      <p> As an <b>aspiring UX designer,</b> I took the <b>lead on creating our app’s wireframes using Figma.</b>
                        I helped my teammates learn Figma and UX design. I also transformed the Tommi sketch into a
                         <b>real avatar in Adobe Illustrator.</b>

                      <h3>ENGINEERING</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> We developed our app in <b>Swift using the XCode IDE and Git</b> to collaborate and resolve conflicts. Our overarching goal was to
                        create a <b>minimal viable product (MVP)</b> of our app consisting of the quest system, app time limitation, and Tommi accessory store.
                      </p>

                      <p> We implemented <b>Firebase to store each user's data.</b> The data includes, username, password, pin code,
                        time limit per category, time coin amount, and quests. I was <b>responsible for developing the kid’s
                        homepage where they can spend time coins on more app time and Tommi’s accessory store.</b>
                      </p>

                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/kidHome.png" class="img-responsive" width="400px" height="500px"/></center>
                      <center><p><i><b>Kid home page on iOS app</b></i></p></center>
                      <br>

                      <p>I used a <b>progress bar to show how much time the kid had left for each app category;</b> I
                        retrieved this data from firebase. There is a plus button next to the progress bar that the
                        kid can press to increase their app time by 5 minutes, which means spending 5 time coins. After pressing the button,
                        the progress bar will increase and the kid's <b>time coin amount will decrease and update firebase’s
                        coin data.</b> Additionally, a pop up telling the kid to check their quests will appear if the kid <b>does not have
                        enough time coins to buy more time.</b>
                      </p>

                      <br>

                      <p> I also developed the <b>avatar store.</b> Each avatar accessory has a price and
                        button to buy and then equip that accessory onto Tommi.

                      <p> If we had more time to develop Tommi, we would allow the user to <b>interact with Tommi through voice commands.</b> It would also be useful to integrate
                        <b>machine learning to automatically adjust app time</b> restrictions based on app usage history and give parents suggested time limits
                        based on the kid's weekly time spent on tech.
                      </p>

                      <p> Based on our user research, customization is important, so my idea was to implement a feature to add
                        to the quest system where parents can <b>create fun, redeemable activities, such as getting icecream,
                          that the kid could save up and redeem with their time coins.</b>
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <br>
                      <p> My team became <b>life long friends.</b> We started as a group of <b>unique individuals, from all over the world</b>
                        (Tunisia, Brazil, China), that are passionate about using technology to change the world. We <b>bonded</b> over our love for
                        Shawn Mendes, our adoable app avatar Tommi, and free food. With my team, I experienced <b>singing while coding and
                        hyping ourselves up by dancing before presenting to Microsoft exectuvies.</b>

                        <p> Through this internship I was able to <b>explore the intersection</b> of design,
                          computer science, and technology. I realized that I <b>want puruse UX design</b>
                          in the tech field, but also know the importance of <b>understanding the technical side of projects.</b>

                       <p> My team worked on our own features of the app, and initially we would rarely merge our code together.
                         This caused <b>major merge conflicts; some resulted in nuking the code.</b> I quickly realized I had to merge smaller
                         portions. But the trick is finding the <b>sweet spot between too big and too small.</b> If it's too big conflicts occur,
                         and if it's too small it gets tedious.
                      </p>
