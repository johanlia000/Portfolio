                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/pills.png" class="img-responsive" width="500" height="300"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p><b>Technology addiction is a growing issue within society,</b>
                          <b>especially in children.</b> Personally, I witness this in family settings
                           where children are mesmerized by their devices. Parents, teachers, and physicians are expressing
                          their concerns, and many in the tech industry are responding with tools aimed at adults and teens.
                          However, my team wanted to <b>develop an app geared towards children, because we felt that establishing
                          healthy relationships with technology early on fosters healthy tech users in the future.</b>
                      </p>

                      <h3>USER IDEATION</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> To represent our <b>user demographic we created two personas:</b> a working parent and her child. This
                        encouraged <b>empathy</b> within my team and allowed us to <b>better understand our users' experiences, behaviors, and goals.</b>
                        The personas also shaped our user journeys.
                      </p>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/wendy.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/charlie.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> With Wendy and Charlie as our inspiration, we created two <b>user journey maps</b> to solidify our goals and understand
                        the <b>relationship between our users and app.</b>
                      </p>

                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/wendyJ.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/charlieJ.png" class="img-responsive" width="700" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> Lastly, we generated <b>user stories to define key, wanted features of the app.</b> This ensured that we created an
                        app that is useful for both parents and children.
                      </p>

                      <hr style="border: .5px solid darkgray;" />
                      <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> To better understand the current market, we performed a <b>SWOT analysis</b> (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats).</p>

                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/apple.png" class="img-responsive" width="300" height="400"></center>
                      <br>

                      <p> We determined that our <b>main competitor was Apple Screen Time.</b> It is successful because it has a
                        beautiful, friendly UI, it’s already integrated into the iPhone, and can be used across multiple devices.
                      </p>

                      <p> I recognized there was a <b>gap with Apple Screen Time and other tech time moderator apps.</b>
                        They all focused on monitoring and setting time limits on screen time and apps, but they
                        <b>lacked a fun, interactive aspect for children.</b> That’s when I had the <b>idea of Tommi, a cute, lovable
                        interactive avatar</b> that serves as the tech time-mediator between the parent and child. My
                        team embraced this concept and wanted to expand on it. Tommi presents a more <b>digestible and fun way for children to participate
                        in tech time boundaries.</b>
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <h3>APP IDEA</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> After a team brainstorming session, we defined the <b>app’s main components and sketched the Tommi avatar.</b></p>
                      <br>

                      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> Microsoft held a BBQ that provided an opportunity to conduct user research.
                          <b>My team and I pitched our initial app idea</b> 12 parents and 2 children and <b>received positive
                          feedback and helpful input.</b>
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <p><b>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</b></p>

                      <p><b>1.</b> One family with four children noted that they already had a Tommi-like system at home
                        using physical coins. They thought <b>integrating a reward feature into a single cohesive app
                        would be a fantastic improvement</b> over their existing tool.</p>
                      <p><b>2.</b> Some parents <b>did not</b> want their children to be able to <b>buy more app time.</b></p>
                      <p><b>3.</b> The <b>children responded positively to Tommi</b> and thought the avatar was adorable.</p>
                      <p><b>4.</b> Most parents said they <b>liked the Quest system the most.</b> They thought it was both <b>unique and useful.</p></b>
                    </div>

                      <h3>IDEATION</h3>

                        <br></br>
                        <p> After our user research, my team discussed the feedback.
                          <b> Customization was an important core feature because every family is unique</b> and has
                          different rules and values associated with technology.
                        </p>
                        <p> Parents thought it would be more meaningful if we <b>created another
                            option where the children could spend their earned Time Coins.</b> I thought that an <b>accessory store
                            would be a fun way</b> for children to interact with Tommi.
                        </p>

                      <p>After talking with our coach, we were unsure what kind of <b>monitoring statistics to show parents.</b>
                          Our coach <b>challenged us</b> to think about how the statistics can support our goal
                          of helping children create a healthy relationship with technology. After significant discussion,
                          we concluded that <b>two key statistical trends would be provided: App Usage and Spendatures (Time Coin usage).</b>
                      </p>

                      <p> As an <b>aspiring UX designer, I led the creation of our wireframes using Figma.</b>
                        I helped my teammates learn Figma and UX design. I also transformed the Tommi sketch into a

                      <h3>ENGINEERING</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> We developed Tommi in <b>Swift using the XCode IDE and relied on Git</b> to collaborate and resolve conflicts.
                         Our overarching goal was to create a <b>minimal viable product (MVP)</b> that consisted of three primary components:
                         Quest system, App Time limitation, and Tommi Accessory Store.
                      </p>

                      <p> We implemented <b>Firebase to store user data.</b> The data includes, username, password, pin code,
                        time limit per category, time coin amount, and quests. I was <b>responsible for coding the child's
                        homepage where the user can spend Time Coins on more App Time and Tommi Accessories.</b>
                      </p>

                      <br>
                      <center><img src="images/TommiApp/kidHome.png" class="img-responsive" width="400px" height="500px"/></center>
                      <center><p><i><b>Child home page on iOS app</b></i></p></center>
                      <br>

                      <p>I implemented a <b>progress bar to show how much time remained for each app category (e.g., games, education, etc);</b> I
                        retrieved this data from Firebase. I located a plus button next to the progress bar that the
                        child can press to increase the app time by 5 minutes, which translates into spending 5 Time Coins. After pressing the button,
                        the progress bar increases and the child's <b>Time Coin amount decreases and updates Firebase’s
                        coin data.</b> Additionally, a <b>pop-up alerts the child to check their Quests;<b> if the child <b>does not have
                        enough Time Coins</b> to buy more app time.
                      </p>

                      <br>

                      <p> I also coded <b>Tommi's Store, which includes various accessories.</b> Each accessory has a price and

                      <h3>FUTURE FEATURES</h3>
                      <br>

                      <p> If we had more time to develop Tommi, we would allow the user to <b>interact with Tommi through voice commands.</b> It would also be useful to integrate
                        <b>machine learning to automatically adjust app time</b> restrictions based on app usage history and suggest time limits based on
                        the child's weekly time spent on tech.
                      </p>

                      <p> My idea is to implement a <b>new feature to the Quest system that enables parents to generate fun, redeemable activities
                        such as getting icecream or visiting the zoo.</b> This encourages the child to save up their time coins.

                      <p> My team became <b>life long friends.</b> We started as a group of <b>unique individuals, from all over the world</b>
                        (Brazil, China, Tunisia, USA), who are passionate about using technology to improve the world. We <b>bonded over our love for
                        Shawn Mendes, our adorable app avatar Tommi, and of course, free food.</b> My team <b>inspired my creativity and fun-loving spirit.</b>
                        We unabashedly sang while coding and hyped ourselves up with dancing before competitive presentations.

                       <p> To meet deadlines, my team worked individually on app features. Initially, we rarely merged our code together.
                         This caused <b>major merge conflicts; some resulted in nuking the code.</b> I quickly realized I had to merge smaller
                         portions of code. But the trick is finding the <b>sweet spot between too big and too small.</b> If it's too big merge conflicts occur,
                         and if it's too small it becomes tedious and very time consuming.
